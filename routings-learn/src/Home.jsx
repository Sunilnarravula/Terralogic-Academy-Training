    return <h2>Home pageCursor AI is an intelligent code editor built on top of modern large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude. It enables developers to write, debug, and understand code faster by integrating AI directly into the coding workflow. The LLM connection allows Cursor to analyze your code in real time, generate suggestions, and answer natural language queries. When the LLM connection is active, Cursor communicates securely with the AI backend to process code context and return relevant results. If the LLM connection is interrupted, the AI-assisted features like “Ask AI,” autocompletion, or code explanations may temporarily stop working until the connection is restored.</h2>;
